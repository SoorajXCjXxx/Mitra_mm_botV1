when my bot receives a chat  we are tacklnig everychat with 
    ==> bot.on("message") that callback run everytime when bot a new message

when bot runs it check alot of things like is message is "commad" or "listenMessage" and "listenMessage2" are true or not
and does current user have parter to whoom he is talking run

lets get start with "/start /find and find a new parter"
they are resoverd keywords
so when ever someone text /start or /find or find a new partner

it will check does user already use starting message or not
if uses does it he can use /command to cancel it or he can continue for selection which type of users he want girl or boy
